# Message Spam Filter with Naive Bayes Algorithm

In this project, we're going to build a SMS spam filter using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Our goal is to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% — so we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).

To train the algorithm, we'll use a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the The UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data collection process is described in more details on this page, where you can also find some of the papers authored by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo.
